# Fundamental Analysis with Yahoo Finance
A procedure to relatively quickly collect all Financial Data (Balance Sheet, Income Statement &amp; Cashflows) as well as Stock Data of pre-selected companies. It makes use of Yahoo Finance that collects data over the last four years. Therefore, this script is also limited to that. Potential optimizations can and should be done when working with hundreds of companies at the same time. 

The script also writes to Excel and seperates this per company. By altering the script a bit, by for example not including the last for loop, one could also bundle all companies together in one file which can be seen in the 'All Symbols' Excel file. This can be very beneficial when you wish to compare different companies and their current performance over the last years.
