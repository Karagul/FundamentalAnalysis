# Yahoo Financial Statement Collector
A procedure to relatively quickly collect all Financial Data (Balance Sheet, Income Statement &amp; Cashflows) of pre-selected companies. It makes use of Yahoo Finance that collects data over the last four years. Therefore, this script is also limited to that. Potential optimizations can and should be done when working with hundreds of companies at the same time. 

The script leaves a lot of room to perform a quantitative industry analysis. Next to that, by also gathering Stock Data, the analysis can be further extended. There is something to say about that these statistics are also given within Yahoo Finance. Thus, you could also scrape them from there via similar methods.
